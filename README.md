## 📰 Description
> Making a resume is never a fun process, it feels more like a chore honestly. We wanted to make a site where you could make your resume's "pop" more and not make it feel as daunting. After submitting a little bit of information about themselves, users then decide which template to use as a template for their resume. Once chosen, our site will do the rest and paste the information into the designated areas.
